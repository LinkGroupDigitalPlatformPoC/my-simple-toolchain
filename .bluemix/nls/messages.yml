template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop, and deploy a microservices application as a Cloud Foundry app in the IBM Bluemix Platfor Service. By default, the toolchain uses a sample java (springboot)  \"Member Management Services\" app, but you can link to your own GitHub repository instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [ source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n **Developer Insights provides a comprehensive way to explore your projectâ€™s development risk. You can identify files with high error proneness and get a compliance view of the project against DevOps practices. Team Dynamics employs social coding analysis to identify the level of interaction between team members so that the team can fix unproductive practices.\n\nAfter you create the toolchain, DevOps Insights starts to mine the GitHub repo and associated issues. The initial mining process can take minutes to hours depending on the size of the repo and the number of issues. After data mining and analysis is complete, you can access the developer and team insights for your project from DevOps Insights in the toolchain.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
